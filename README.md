# Efficient-Data-Stream-Anomaly-Detection
This project implements an efficient algorithm for detecting anomalies in a continuous data stream. The algorithm uses the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) method to identify unusual patterns in the data stream.

The project consists of three main components:

Data Stream Simulation: A Python script (data_stream_simulation.py) generates a simulated data stream, incorporating regular patterns, seasonal elements, and random noise.
\n Anomaly Detection: A Python script (anomaly_detection.py) implements the MAD algorithm to detect anomalies in the data stream.
Real-time Visualization: A Python script (visualization.py) creates a real-time visualization tool to display both the data stream and any detected anomalies.
To run the project, execute the anomaly_detection.py script. This will generate a simulated data stream, detect anomalies, and visualize the results.
