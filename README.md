# Efficient-Data-Stream-Anomaly-Detection
This project implements an efficient algorithm for detecting anomalies in a continuous data stream. The algorithm leverages the **Median Absolute Deviation (MAD)** method to identify unusual patterns in the data.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main components:

1. **Data Stream Simulation** (`data_stream_simulation.py`): 
   - Simulates a continuous data stream with regular patterns, seasonal elements, and random noise.

2. **Anomaly Detection** (`anomaly_detection.py`): 
   - Implements the MAD algorithm to detect anomalies in the data stream.

3. **Real-time Visualization** (`visualization.py`): 
   - Provides real-time visualization of the data stream and detected anomalies.

## Requirements

To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
